Value can be direct: “Generate more sales.” It can be indirect: “Enable our users to perform these tasks that will increse sales.” Or it can be better understanding: “Will this improve our sales?”

Value doesn't have to be related to income and sales. It depends on what your team's purpose is. Here are some examples:

- Save children from poverty
- Treat patients
- Avoid war
- Acquire the Babe Ruth baseball card
