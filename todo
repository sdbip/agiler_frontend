# Tasks
- Create a UI view for entering username if not yet set. Make it utterly simplistic as it should not be kept around.
- Add simplistic autorization header that identifies the user ('Authorization': username)
- Add Accept header ('Accept': 'application/json') to all backend calls
- CSS tests?
