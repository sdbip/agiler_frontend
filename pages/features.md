Collect your <a class="hover-help" data-snippet="feature">features</a> here.

> **Guideline:** Prefer *Minimal Marketable Features* (<a class="hover-help" data-snippet="mmf">MMFs</a>).

> 2. Next: split the features into <a class="hover-help" data-snippet="mmf">MMFs</a>. What's the smallest incremental step that would serve some of that need?
