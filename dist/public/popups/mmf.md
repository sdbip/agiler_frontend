When prioritising a feature, it should be *Minimal* so that it can be finished and deployed quickly. It should be *Marketable* so that its value is clear.

If your top prioritised feature is very small your team can focus on it alone, and deploy it before starting another. That can allow you to deploy more frequently and with less risk.

You don't have to make features minimal as you collect them. Instead, your first focus should be on need. What does your business lack right now that your product could provide? You will have the opportunity to split them later.
